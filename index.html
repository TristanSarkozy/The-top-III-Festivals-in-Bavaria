                        The crown Prince Ludwig (1786-1868), later King Ludwig I (reign: 1825-1848), married Princess
                        Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen on 12 October 1810.
                        The citizens of Munich were invited to attend the festivities held on the fields in front of the
                        city gates to celebrate the royal event.
                        The fields were named Theresienwiese ("Theresa's Meadow") in honor of the Crown Princess, and
                        have kept that name ever since, although the locals have abbreviated the name simply to Wiesn. 
                        Horse races, in the tradition of the 15th-century Scharlachrennen (Scarlet Race at Karlstor), 
                        were held to honor the newlyweds.

                    <p>
                        The Sandkerwa is Bamberg's most beautiful folk festival and is one of the largest and most
                        beautiful folk festivals in Bavaria.
                        The consecration of St. Elisabethenkirche is celebrated in the historic old town
                        of Bamberg. The Sandkerwa is a unique combination of tradition and modernity.
                        Over 200,000 visitors celebrate every year in the narrow streets of Bamberg and enjoy the
                        romantic ambiance in front of Little Venice.
                        An amusement park with bumper cars, a carousel, a raffle, a shooting gallery and catering is usually
                        set up at Markusplatz. There is live music in the marquee at Leinritt, in front of Bruderm√ºhle
                        and at Katzenberg.
