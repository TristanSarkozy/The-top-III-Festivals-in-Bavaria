  </p>​The worlds oldest food or beverage laws still in use, the beer purity laws from Bavaria in 1516 (Reinheitsgebot), have kept the oldest beers here as authentic and delicious as the day they were first created. This southern German region hosts the most breweries per capita, the largest hop-growing region, and the oldest operating brewery worldwide! Some of the beer companies we introduce you to have been operating for almost 1,000 years (they do make fresh batches though!).</p>
  <p>​The Thirsty Historian was an idea created by two guys who have a passion for history while at the same time drinking one of their favorite brews, which they often find themselves doing. We started The Thirsty Historian based on our love of beer and history, and there's no better place to discover beer the way it was originally intended than in Bavaria.</p>
  <p>​Both of us have found that not much is better than being at great historical locations with the best company accompanied by fantastic local food and beer; the definition of true Bavarian 'Gemütlichkeit.' We find that the state of Bavaria and the surrounding region in south Germany has everything needed to fulfill these requirements and we would love to help you experience it as well!</p>
