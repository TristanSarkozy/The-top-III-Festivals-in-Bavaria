        <h3>Oktoberfest</h3>
        <p>
            The krown prince Ludwig (1786-1868), later King Ludwig I (reign: 1825-1848), married Princess Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen on 12 October 1810. 
            The citizens of Munich were invited to attend the festivities held on the fields in front of the city gates to celebrate the royal event. 
            The fields were named Theresienwiese ("Theresa's Meadow") in honour of the Crown Princess, and have kept that name ever since, although the locals 
            have abbreviated the name simply to Wiesn. Horse races, in the tradition of the 15th-century Scharlachrennen (Scarlet Race at Karlstor), were held on 18 October to honor the newlyweds. 
            It is widely believed that Andreas Michael Dall'Armi, a major in the National Guard, proposed the idea. However, the origins of the horse races, and Oktoberfest itself, may have stemmed 
            from proposals offered by Franz Baumgartner, a coachman and sergeant in the National Guard. The precise origins of the festival and horse races remain a matter of controversy. 
            However, the decision to repeat the horse races, spectacle, and celebrations in 1811 launched what is now the annual Oktoberfest tradition.
            The fairground, once outside the city, was chosen due to its natural suitability, which it still holds today. The Sendlinger Hill (today Theresienhohe) was used as a grandstand for 40,000 race spectators. 
            The festival grounds remained undeveloped, except for the king's tent. The tastings of "Traiteurs" and other wine and beer took place above the visitors in the stands on the hill. 
            Before the race started, a performance was held in homage of the bridegroom and of the royal family in the form of a train of 16 pairs of children dressed in Wittelsbach costumes, and costumes 
            from the nine Bavarian townships and other regions. This was followed by the punishing race with 30 horses on a 3,400 metres (11,200 ft) long racetrack, and concluded with the singing of a student choir. 
            The first horse to cross the finish line belonged to Franz Baumgartner (one of the purported festival initiators). Horse racing champion and Minister of State Maximilian von Montgelas presented Baumgartner with his gold medal.

        <h3>Tollwood</h3>
        <p>
        Tollwood Festival is organized by the Tollwood GmbH. The festival takes place on approximately 30,000-meter ground area. 
        It has around 900,000 visitors in summer and in winter about 600,000. Financing is covered by approximately 40% from ticket sales, 40% of the rental income on stand operators and 20% from sponsors. 
        Government grants are not included. Special features of the festival were the marketplace of ideas, the ecological gastronomy festival and the cultural program of music, various forms of theater, performances 
        and visual art. The festival featured a wide range of musical styles such as rock, singer-songwriters, jazz and blues. Furthermore, theatrical and artistic performances were also held.
        Since 1988, the Tollwood festival focuses on different contents and takes a different forms and genres each year. The festival attempts to connect the cultural offerings of music, theater, cabaret and
        art with an ecological consciousness. Here, a large part of the cultural events that take place offer free admission. The festival sees itself as a forum for ecology and environmental awareness. 
        It wants to serve as a platform for important topics in this area and provide a catalyst for environmental projects. This entails the organic certification of the gastronomy festival since winter 2003
        and the "Bio for children" action, that the Tollwood developed in 2006, in cooperation with the Department of Health and Environment of the City of Munich. Program highlights are seasonal selected by the festival.
        In cooperation with Deutsche Tierschutzbund e.V. (German Animal Welfare Society), Tollwood campaigns for an end to the intensive animal farming.

    <h3>Sandkerwa</h3>
    <p>
        The Sandkerwa is Bamberg's most beautiful folk festival and is one of the largest and most beautiful folk festivals in Bavaria
        In five days, the consecration of St. Elisabethenkirche is celebrated in the historic old town of Bamberg. The Sandkerwa is a unique combination of tradition and modernity. 
        Over 200,000 visitors celebrate every year in the narrow streets of Bamberg and enjoy the romantic ambience in front of Little Venice.
        An amusement park with bumper cars, carousel, raffle, shooting gallery and catering is usually set up at Markusplatz. There is live music in the marquee at Leinritt, in front of Bruderm√ºhle and at Katzenberg.
        Among the programme highlights are the traditional fisherman's stabbing, the cock-blowing, in which participants try to smash clay pots while blindfolded, an organ concert and a closing fireworks display.
        Those who wish to support the Kirchweih financially can purchase a festival badge at the office of the citizens' association or at various booths during each Sandkerwa. 
        The proceeds help with the financing and thus contribute to the preservation of the traditional Kirchweih.
